# sqlalchemy-challenge
SQL Alchemy Challenge is a project using the Python *SQL Alchemy* library to read in SQL database and analyze Hawaii climate and radio station data. In addition, the project uses the Python *Flask* library to create a climate app that has pages for the different queries to the climate database.
## Analysis 
* Filter to last 12 months of precipitation data
* Plot of precipitation (prcp) data by date of the last 12 month
* Total number of stations
* Most active stations and temperature min, max, and mean of most active station
* Filter to last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS)
* TOBS histogram plot
## Where to Find the Data
The data can be found in the *Resources* folder:
* Precipitation Data, *hawaii_measurements.csv*
* Station Data, *hawaii_stations.csv*
## Where to Find Climate and Station Analysis
The analysis can be found in the *Analysis* folder:
* Climate and Station Analysis Notebook, *climate_analysis.ipynb*

In addition, the climate app code can be found:
* Climate app python file, *climate_app.py*
